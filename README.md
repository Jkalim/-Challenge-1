# -Challenge-1
Kickstarter Challenge

##-Overview 
The project consists of analyzing the outcomes of the theater parent category by the year of their launch date and --- 
the outcome of the "plays" subcategory based on the set goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

* To perform the analysis for the theater category, a table filtered by the year showing the each outcome was created. 
The outcomes where then combined to show the number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes there are by months that can be ---
filtered for each year. Anticipated challenges for this project could be changing or leaving out some of the raw data while ---
while populating the outcomes. 

* To perform the analysis for the plays subcategory, a count of the outcomes of the plays was populated based on different ranges of---
the set goal for each play and the percentage of each outcome was calculated for each range. Possible challenges could be doubting the raw data---
when one or more the outcomes come out to be a 0. It is possible to believe that something was left out when we encounter a 0 in the table ---
from all this data. 

## Conclusion

* Theater outcome by launch date
There are 75% more successful outcomes than failed and canceled outcomes combined. The theater category is deemed successful overall. 

* Plays subcategory by goals
Most of the goals are succesful overall except for the $25,000 to $35,000 and the over $45,000 range where the failed percentage is significantly---
better. Low budget goals for plays are likely to be successful. 


## Limitations
The data set shows the facts but no explanation can be provided as far as why all outcomes are not successful. 

## Other possible tables and graphs
 the theater and plays ouctomes by country could be helpful as we would get an insight on what region to try to fix or abort the campaingn. Graphs ---
 by countries would give us a clear visualization as far as which region is failing and succeeding.
